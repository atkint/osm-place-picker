# OSM Place Picker

A utility to help reduce data entry on place names.

It queries the nearest OpenStreetMap node using the [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) API.

It will also query [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) to potentially find old names and a list of wikipedia articles for historical references.
